# Predictive Analysis of Bus Engine Replacement: A Logistic Regression Approach

## Overview

This project focuses on performing predictive analysis to determine the optimal time for replacing bus engines using a Logistic Regression approach. The goal is to create a model that can predict when a bus engine needs replacement based on relevant features and historical data.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following components:

- **Code**: The Python code for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **Dataset**: The dataset used for training and testing the model (`bus1234.csv`).
- **README**: This document, providing a detailed explanation of the project.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhancing the visualizations with a consistent style.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning tasks, including train-test split, data preprocessing, logistic regression, and model evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is bus1234.csv. This dataset contains historical data related to bus engine performance, maintenance, and replacements. The features in the dataset are used to build the predictive model, and the target variable is likely related to the condition of the engine (e.g., whether it needs replacement).

## Methodology

The project involves the following steps:

- Data Loading: The dataset (bus1234.csv) is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

- Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and any necessary feature engineering is performed.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analyses are conducted to gain insights into the dataset. This step helps in understanding 
                                   the relationships between features and the target variable.

- Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using the train_test_split function from scikit-learn.

- Feature Scaling: Standardization is applied to ensure that all features have the same scale, which is important for many machine learning algorithms, 
                   including logistic regression.

- Model Building: A logistic regression model is constructed using the training data.

- Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using the testing data. Classification metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy are calculated  
                    using the classification_report function.

- Results and Conclusion: The results of the analysis are interpreted, and conclusions are drawn based on the model's performance.

## Running the Code

To run the code, follow these steps:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Install the required libraries using the following command:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
Download the dataset bus1234.csv and place it in the project directory.
Execute the Python code provided in the project's code file.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of logistic regression for predictive analysis of bus engine replacement. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can replicate the analysis, understand the model's performance, and make informed decisions regarding engine replacement based on the provided dataset. The insights gained from this project may have real-world implications for optimizing maintenance schedules and minimizing downtime.
